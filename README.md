## Dashboard Features
SafeHeart Dashboard contains two components - "Predict Heart Disease Risk" and "Data Visualizations"

### Predict Heart Disease Risk
This tab in the dashboard allows the user to enter details of a patient and those inputs will be used to run our prediction model to give the user information about whether or not the patient is at risk for heart disease. It will also show two graphs comparing weight and BMI overall and by the entered sex in relative to the entered information.
